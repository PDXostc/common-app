Matt,
 
It was a pleasure meeting you as well. As requested, I have created a demo API key for you and your team that provides limited content from all of our available API endpoints.
 
API Key: c15a496f002b40aaad42797852e9b09e
API Authorizations: Locations, Current Conditions, Alerts, Forecast 5-Day, Forecast 12-Hour, Indices 5-Day, Alarms 5-Day, Climo, Translations, Maps
 
We ask and recommend that you please use the apidev.accuweather.com links listed in the documentation for testing at this time. The api.accuweather.com links are meant for production only. You can learn more about the APIs and see examples of how they work from our online documentation page: http://apidev.accuweather.com/
 
Please take a look and let us know if you need anything else at this time. We are always happy to help in any way we can. Thank you and have a great day.
 
-Mark
