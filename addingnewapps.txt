Instructions for import into commons...

Commons is designed to take care of itself.  Every common import is reduced to 
two files style.css and init.js.  You still need the apps specific includes.

Note do not use files in common/css/car or common/css/user as these will 
go away.  These are only provided to help smooth transistion of other apps.

Also js/services will be going away as well.  All files will be moved to 
a more approprate structor.  Note most of them should be there now.
