THEMES
=====================================

The theme files are in the "EDJE Data Colection" (.edc) format. 

Reference:
     http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/edje/edcref.html

All of the layout and behaviour is defined in the common.edc 
file in this directory. Each of the separate themes has
defintion files for each supported size, and provides the
individual color / image files.

In addition, the file "wkb" is a language defintion file.
The specification is the same as for "us" except the modified
(i.e. shifted) keypad keys are the special use keys for 
this keypad (e.g. £, €, etc).
